## Bathroom

According to the calculater at [hudsonreed](https://nl.hudsonreed.com/hudson-reed-radiator-vermogen-calculator)

509w for 4.8m^2 including windows, 2 exterior, brick, insulated walls and an attic with 100mm+ insulation above it.

Other calculations (like [badkamerxxl](https://www.badkamerxxl.nl/verwarming/radiator-vermogen-berekenen)) assume 85w per m^3 for 24 degrees, which is advised for a bathroom. Which would result in 849w

For now we assume for calculation:

		800w

## Bedroom 2
![[Pasted image 20250309230435.png]]

Since this is a bedroom we would like to also cool this room. Therefore we require a cooling capacity and heating capacity

We assume a factor of 40 according to [warmtepompgigant](https://www.warmtepompgigant.nl/verwarmen-en-koelen/capaciteit-airco-berekenen/)

For 9.8m^2 and a height of 2.5m would come down to a cooling capacity of

		980w

And for heating according to [cvtotaal](https://www.cvtotaal.nl/radiatoren/berekenen) we need 1450w at "Good" insulation and 18 degrees

Other websites quote 70w at 18 degrees and would come down to 1680w

So for now we assum:

		1600w
## Master bedroom

The master bedroom has an adjacent walk in closet we also need to take into account.

Since this is another bedroom we re-use the numbers from bedroom no 2:

Cooling capacity

22.9m^2 x 2.5m x 40 = 

		2290w


Heating capacity

22.9m^2 x 2.5m x (1600/9.8*2.5) = 

		3840w

According to this [table](https://gidsduurzamegebouwen.brussels/leidingen-dimensioneren-om-drukverliezen-beperken) at a delta T of 20 degrees for ventilated convectors, like fan coils, a DN15 sized tube can carry 7kw of heat at vmax of 0.4m/s

Therefore we need to use [Henco Alupex meerlagenbuis ISO9 10mm rood](https://www.warmteservice.nl/Installatiemateriaal/Leidingsystemen/Meerlagenbuis/Henco-Alupex-meerlagenbuis-ISO-10-mm-rood/p/48670225)

#wisecoco #RaspberryPI 

Our living room needs a "dashboard" for controlling everything in our house. The location is dermined to be next to the hallway door where current light switches are located.

Options considered:
- Tablet with poe
- Raspberry pi with touchscreen

Because I want to be in full control of whatever is running on it. My preference goes to a raspberry pi running android. It will be running mostly a home assistant dashboard (in Fully Kiosk Browser?)

Also because anything with a battery might be dangerous. Or at least draw more power.

The pillar to mount anything on is only 320mm wide so 13.3" touchscreens are out.

After recommendation by GreatScott the current choice is:

The [wisecoco 11" amoled 2K 4:3 screen:](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005001626069769.html)

Functionality to be determined:
- Camera
- Voice assistant

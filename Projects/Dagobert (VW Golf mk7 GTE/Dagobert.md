Dagobert is the family golf. It's a 2015 Golf GTE although the previous owner has already kitted it out with some good stuff. I plan on adding my own.

For instance:
- [[Retrofit TPMS]]
- [Front lanekeeping camera](https://fededim.github.io/Retrofits/Golf_MK7.5/Lane%20Assist/Volkswagen%20Golf%20MK7.5%20Facelift%20Lane%20Assist%20Retrofit%20V1.1.pdf)
- [Heated front window](https://fededim.github.io/Retrofits/Golf_MK7.5/Heated%20Windscreen/Volkswagen%20Golf%20MK7.5%20Facelift%20Heated%20Windscreen%20Retrofit%20V1.0.1.pdf)
